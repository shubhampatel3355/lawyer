    "Heading": "Why Legal Readiness Matters",

    "Point1": "Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) :<br> Founders often focus on product, team, and pitch decks—while skipping legal groundwork. But investors look for clarity, structure, and risk mitigation. These 7 documents show you're serious, compliant, and ready to scale.",
    "Point2": "Founders' Agreement :<br> Aligning with your co-founder(s) early is crucial. This agreement defines roles, responsibilities, equity split, vesting, and exit terms—preventing future fallouts that could ruin your startup.",
    "Point3": "Startup Employment Agreement :<br> Hiring your first team? A Startup Employment Agreement sets expectations, salary terms, IP rights, and confidentiality—protecting both the startup and employee.",
    "Point4": "Equity Vesting Agreement :<br> To avoid giving away equity too early, vesting clauses ensure that founders and early employees earn their shares over time—keeping long-term incentives aligned.",

    "description1": "Before approaching investors, it's not just about building a great product or pitch deck—your startup’s legal hygiene matters just as much. These seven agreements aren’t just paperwork; they show that you’re prepared, responsible, and serious about protecting your company’s future. From defining co-founder roles to securing investor confidence, these legal documents serve as the backbone of any scalable business.",
    
    "Heading1": "Conclusion :",
    "description2": "Investors trust startups that are legally sound. Getting these agreements in place early can save you from costly mistakes, internal disputes, or fundraising delays later. Whether you're bootstrapping or preparing for a seed round, investing in the right legal foundation today ensures you're ready for growth tomorrow.",
